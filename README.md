I chose the 4th task (QAOA). The graph that I have chosen is taken from [this page](https://tc3-japan.github.io/DA_tutorial/tutorial-3-max-cut.html).
After running the code with `py main.py`, it first shows you an initial drawing of the graph, then, after a few seconds, shows a bar chart of the probabilites of the answers that it has found, and finally, for the two answers with the highest probabilities, shows the edges between the two subgraphs that it has produced. (Doesn't show the edges within each subgraph.)
